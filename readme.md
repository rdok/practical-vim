Journey through the Practical Vim: Edit Text at the Speed of Thought

## 1 The Vim Way
Repetition is the vim way. Train yourself to code by crafting repeatable unit of works, repeatable by vim. This is the vim way.

### Repeatable changes
> A change could act at the level of individual characters, entire lines, or even whole file. Motions are not repeatable because they do not change text.

- The `x` command deletes the character under the cursor.
- The `dd` command performs a deletion on the current line as a whole.
- The `>G` command increases the indentation from the current line until the end of the file.
